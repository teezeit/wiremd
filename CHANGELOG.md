## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Inline comments** — standard HTML comment syntax (`<!-- text -->`) renders as yellow sticky-note callouts in all HTML output. Comments attach to the element that follows them in source; work at any nesting depth inside `:::` containers.
- `showComments` option in `RenderOptions` (default `true`) — pass `false` to strip all comment callouts from output
- `--show-comments` / `--hide-comments` CLI flags (comments hidden by default in CLI output — opt-in with `--show-comments`)
- Comments toggle in the web editor preview toolbar (pill toggle)
- Comments On/Off button in the VS Code extension preview toolbar

- Fixed npm global installation by adding a proper CLI wrapper (`bin/wiremd.js`)
