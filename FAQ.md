## Getting Started

### What is wiremd?

wiremd is a text-first UI design tool that lets you create wireframes and mockups using Markdown syntax. Write your UI in plain text, render it as HTML with various visual styles.

### How do I get started?

1. Check out the [Syntax Showcase](examples/showcase.md) for interactive examples
2. Use the [Quick Reference](QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for syntax lookups
3. See [Installation Guide](docs/guide/installation.md) for setup instructions

### What Markdown flavor does wiremd use?

wiremd is built on standard CommonMark Markdown with custom extensions for UI components. All standard Markdown syntax works as expected.

### Can I use wiremd without installing anything?

Currently, wiremd requires Node.js installation. A web-based version is planned for the future.

## Syntax Questions

### How do I know if something is a button or a link?

**Button:** `[Text]` - No URL following
**Link:** `[Text](url)` - Has URL in parentheses

```markdown
[Click Me]           # Button
[Click Me](http://example.com)  # Link
```

### Why isn't my input showing a label?

**Labels must be directly above inputs with NO blank line between them.**

```markdown
✅ Correct:
Name
[_____________________________]

❌ Wrong (blank line breaks association):
Name

[_____________________________]
```

### How do I create a dropdown with options?

Use the `v` suffix and put list items directly after:

```markdown
Country
[Select country...v]
- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
```

The list items must be directly after the dropdown (can have one blank line max).

### Can I put placeholder text in inputs?

Yes, put text before the underscores:

```markdown
[Enter your name___________]
[email@example.com_________]{type:email}
```

**Note:** This syntax currently renders as a button in some cases - a known limitation being addressed.

### How do I make a primary/highlighted button?

Three ways:

```markdown
[Submit]*                  # Asterisk shorthand
[Submit]{.primary}         # Class attribute
[Submit]{variant:primary}  # Variant attribute
```

## Common Issues

### My grid isn't working

**Check these:**

1. Grid class is on the parent heading: `## Title {.grid-3 card}`
2. Grid items are `###` headings (one level deeper)
3. Each grid item starts with `###`

```markdown
✅ Correct:
## Features {.grid-3 card}

### Feature 1
Content

### Feature 2
Content

❌ Wrong (missing ### for items):
## Features {.grid-3 card}
Feature 1
Feature 2
```

### Attributes are being ignored

**Common causes:**

1. **Too much space:** Attributes should be immediately after element (one space is OK)
   ```markdown
   ✅ [Button]{.primary}
   ✅ [Button] {.primary}
   ❌ [Button]   {.primary}  # Too much space
   ```

2. **Wrong syntax:** Use `{.class}` for classes, `{key:value}` for attributes
   ```markdown
   ✅ {.primary type:submit}
   ❌ {primary type=submit}
   ```

3. **Applied to wrong element:** Attributes apply to the immediately preceding element

### My navigation bar isn't rendering correctly

**Check the syntax:**

```markdown
✅ Correct:
[[ Home | Products | About ]]

❌ Wrong (missing spaces around pipes):
[[Home|Products|About]]

❌ Wrong (single brackets):
[ Home | Products | About ]
```

### Container not rendering

**Check for:**

1. Proper `:::` syntax with matching opening/closing
2. Space after `:::`
3. Container type is valid

```markdown
✅ Correct:
::: card
Content here
:::

❌ Wrong (no space after :::):
:::card
Content
:::

❌ Wrong (mismatched closing):
::: card
Content
::
```

### Icons not showing

**Check that:**

1. Icon syntax uses colons: `:icon-name:`
2. Icon name exists in the supported set
3. No spaces inside colons: `:home:` not `: home :`

```markdown
✅ Correct: :home: :user: :gear:
❌ Wrong: : home : :user-icon:
```

---

## Components

### What input types are supported?

All HTML5 input types:

```markdown
{type:text}      # Default
{type:email}     # Email with validation
{type:password}  # Password (hidden)
{type:tel}       # Telephone
{type:url}       # URL
{type:number}    # Number with spinners
{type:date}      # Date picker
{type:time}      # Time picker
{type:search}    # Search box
{type:color}     # Color picker
{type:file}      # File upload
```

### How do I create radio buttons?

Use the radio syntax with parentheses:

```markdown
Choose a plan:
- (*) Free Plan (selected)
- ( ) Pro Plan
- ( ) Enterprise
```

`(*)` indicates the selected radio button.

### How do I create checkboxes?

Use standard Markdown task list syntax:

```markdown
- [x] Checked item
- [ ] Unchecked item
- [x] Another checked item
```

### Can I create multi-line textareas?

Yes, use the `{rows:N}` attribute:

```markdown
Comments
[Your comments here...]{rows:5}

# Or with more attributes:
Description
[Describe your project...]{rows:8 cols:60}
```

### How do I create disabled or loading states?

Use state attributes:

```markdown
[Submit]{state:disabled}
[Processing...]{state:loading}
[Delete]{state:error}
[Saved]{state:success}
```

---

## Layout & Styling

### What grid sizes are supported?

Built-in grid classes:
- `{.grid-2 card}` - 2 columns
- `{.grid-3 card}` - 3 columns
- `{.grid-4 card}` - 4 columns
- `{.grid-auto}` - Auto-fit columns

### Can I nest containers?

Yes! Containers can be nested:

```markdown
::: hero
# Welcome

::: card
### Get Started
[Sign Up]*
:::
:::
```

### What visual styles are available?

wiremd supports multiple rendering styles:

```bash
--style sketch      # Default: Balsamiq-style hand-drawn
--style clean       # Modern minimal design
--style wireframe   # Traditional grayscale
--style material    # Material Design
--style tailwind    # Tailwind-inspired
--style brutal      # Neo-brutalist
--style none        # Unstyled semantic HTML
```

### How do I add custom CSS classes?

Use the class attribute syntax:

```markdown
## Section {.my-custom-class}
[Button]{.btn .btn-lg .custom}
```

Classes are applied to the rendered HTML element.

### Can I use inline styles?

Not currently. Use classes and apply CSS separately, or use the `style:none` option and add your own CSS.

---

## Advanced Usage

### Can I include one wiremd file in another?

Not in v0.1. Template/partial includes are planned for v0.2+.

### How do I create responsive layouts?

Basic responsive support is included via CSS grid, but explicit breakpoint syntax is planned for v0.2+.

Currently, grids automatically stack on mobile using CSS media queries.

### Can I export to React/Vue/Svelte?

HTML export is fully supported. React/Vue/Svelte component exports are in development and planned for Phase 5.

### How do I create tabs or accordions?

Tabs and accordions are planned but not yet implemented in v0.1. See [SYNTAX-SPEC-v0.1.md](SYNTAX-SPEC-v0.1.md#16-version-01-scope) for the roadmap.

### Can I add custom JavaScript interactions?

wiremd generates static HTML. For interactivity, you'll need to add JavaScript separately or wait for framework-specific renderers (React/Vue/Svelte).

### How do I create modal/dialog overlays?

Use the modal container:

```markdown
::: modal
### Confirm Action
Are you sure you want to proceed?

[Confirm]* [Cancel]
:::
```

The modal container is rendered but not automatically shown as an overlay. You'll need to add CSS/JS for overlay behavior.

### Can I validate forms?

HTML5 validation attributes are supported:

```markdown
Email
[_____________________________]{type:email required}

Age
[___]{type:number min:18 max:120}

Website
[_____________________________]{type:url}
```

The rendered HTML includes these validation attributes.

## Troubleshooting Checklist

When something isn't working, check:

- [ ] Is there a blank line where there shouldn't be? (especially labels and inputs)
- [ ] Are the brackets correct? `[[ ]]` for nav, `[ ]` for buttons/inputs
- [ ] Are attribute curly braces immediately after the element?
- [ ] For grids, is the class on `##` and items on `###`?
- [ ] For containers, is there a space after `:::`?
- [ ] For dropdowns, is the list directly after the `[...v]`?
- [ ] Are you using the right syntax? Check [Quick Reference](QUICK-REFERENCE.md)
