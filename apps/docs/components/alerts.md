# Alerts

> **Not yet implemented.** The `::: alert` container parses correctly but has no dedicated renderer — it falls back to a generic `<div>`. Variants (`.success`, `.warning`, `.error`) are not visually distinguished. This page documents the intended syntax for when it is implemented.

`::: alert` renders a highlighted message block. Add a variant class to control the tone.
