  Create and render wireframes using wiremd — a text-first tool that converts Markdown into visual
  HTML mockups. Use this skill whenever the user wants to wireframe, mockup, prototype, or sketch
  a UI screen — from a description, Jira ticket, PRD, existing React/JSX, or rough idea. Also
  trigger on: "draw a login page", "show what this would look like", "create a mockup", "design
  a screen for X", "sketch the UI", "prototype this flow", "document this component as a
  wireframe", or any request to render or preview a .md wireframe file. When in doubt, use this
  skill — it's better to invoke it unnecessarily than to miss it.

# Wireframe Skill

Write a wiremd `.md` file, render it, and iterate. wiremd converts plain Markdown with extended
syntax into visual wireframes — 7 styles, no design tools needed.

## Workflows

### 1. Create from a description or spec
1. Understand the screen's purpose — what does the user accomplish here?
2. Sketch structure top-to-bottom: nav → layout → content sections → forms/data → off-screen elements (modals)
3. Write the wiremd file using the quick reference below
4. Render and tell the user where to open it

### 2. Document an existing component or screen
1. Read the JSX/TSX component tree — focus on structure, not logic
2. Map components to wiremd equivalents (see `references/syntax.md` → Component mapping table)
3. Write top-to-bottom following visual flow
4. **Capture:** layout, navigation, form fields/labels, button labels, table columns, states
5. **Skip:** exact colors, event handlers, API calls, business logic

## Rendering

```bash
# Live preview in browser with hot reload
wiremd my-screen.md --style clean --serve 3001 --watch

# Build to a static HTML file
wiremd my-screen.md -o output.html -s clean

# VS Code: Cmd+Shift+P → "wiremd: Open Preview" (live preview while editing)
# See references/vscode.md for extension install steps
```

Tell the user: open `http://localhost:3001` for live preview, or the HTML path for a static file.

To screenshot and verify from the CLI:
```bash
npx playwright screenshot --browser chromium --full-page "file://$(pwd)/output.html" /tmp/wf-check.png
```
Then read the PNG with the Read tool.

## Style picker

Default to `clean` unless the user specifies otherwise. See `references/styles.md` for full descriptions.

| Style | Best for |
|-------|----------|
| `sketch` | Early ideation, lo-fi client presentations |
| `clean` | Stakeholder review, internal handoff (default) |
| `wireframe` | Low-fidelity explorations, documentation |
| `material` | Material Design apps |
| `brutal` | Bold, high-contrast concepts |
| `none` | Custom CSS, embedding elsewhere |

## Gotchas

1. **Label directly above input.** No blank line between label text and `[_____]` — it breaks the association.
2. **Blank line before `:::` when last line has inline elements.** Buttons, backtick code, bold, links, or list items on the final line of a container — add an empty line before `:::`.
3. **`[[ ]]` nav doesn't support hrefs.** Links inside `[[ ]]` silently drop the URL. Use plain markdown links for cross-page navigation.
4. **`:::tabs` and `:::accordion` don't exist.** Use button groups (`[Tab]*  [Other]`) for in-page tabs; use one file per tab for multi-page tab sets.
5. **`:::display` is VS Code-only.** The include directive doesn't work in the CLI renderer.
