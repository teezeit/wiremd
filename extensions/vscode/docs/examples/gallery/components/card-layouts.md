## 12. Grid Layout vs Card Grid

### Pure Layout Grid (no card chrome)

Use `::: grid-N` alone when items are form fields, text columns, or anything that shouldn't have card borders/backgrounds.

```markdown
::: grid-2

### Your Details
Name
[_____________________________]{required}

Email
[_____________________________]{type:email required}

### Message
Subject
[_____________________________]{required}

[Send Message]*

:::
```

**Rendered:**

::: grid-2

### Your Details
Name
[_____________________________]{required}

Email
[_____________________________]{type:email required}

### Message
Subject
[_____________________________]{required}

[Send Message]*

:::

---

### Card Grid (with card chrome)

Add `card` to apply card borders and backgrounds to each item.

```markdown
::: grid-3 card

### :rocket: Fast
Renders in milliseconds.

### :shield: Secure
Enterprise-grade by default.

### :gear: Flexible
Works with any stack.

:::
```

### :gear: Flexible

### Column Spanning

Add `{.col-span-N}` to a child heading to span multiple columns.

```markdown
::: grid-3 card

### Starter
$9/month — up to 3 projects.

### Pro {.col-span-2}
$29/month — unlimited projects, priority support, spans two columns.

## Best Practices

::: card

### Card Design Guidelines

1. **Consistent Spacing**
   - Maintain uniform padding
   - Use consistent card heights in grids
   - Balance content density

2. **Clear Hierarchy**
   - Use heading levels appropriately
   - Primary action should be prominent
   - Group related information

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Use grid layouts (.grid-2, .grid-3, etc.)
   - Cards should stack on mobile
   - Images should scale properly

4. **Content Strategy**
   - Keep card content concise
   - Use clear call-to-action
   - Include relevant imagery

5. **Visual Balance**
   - Don't overcrowd cards
   - Use whitespace effectively
   - Maintain alignment

:::

**Style Variations:**
- `sketch` - Hand-drawn card wireframes
- `clean` - Modern minimal cards
- `wireframe` - Structure-focused cards
- `tailwind` - Contemporary card design
- `material` - Elevated Google-style cards
- `brutal` - Bold card layouts
- `none` - Semantic HTML for custom styling

**Generate this example:**
```bash
wiremd card-layouts.md --style sketch
wiremd card-layouts.md --style clean -o cards-clean.html
wiremd card-layouts.md --style material -o cards-material.html
```
