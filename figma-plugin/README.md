## Installation

### Option 1: Install from Figma Community (Recommended)

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate wiremd JSON

Use the wiremd CLI to convert your markdown mockup to JSON:

```bash
mdmock your-mockup.md --format json -o mockup.json
```

Example markdown:
```markdown
[[ Logo | Home | Products | About | [Sign In] ]]

::: hero

### Step 2: Open Plugin in Figma

1. Open Figma
2. Menu → Plugins → wiremd Importer
3. Select your preferred visual theme:
   - **Sketch** - Balsamiq-style hand-drawn look
   - **Clean** - Modern minimal design
   - **Wireframe** - Traditional grayscale
   - **Minimal** - Unstyled for custom CSS

### Step 3: Import JSON

1. Copy the contents of `mockup.json`
2. Paste into the text area
3. Click "Import to Figma"
4. Your design appears as a new page with editable components!

## Visual Themes

### Sketch Theme
- Hand-drawn, Balsamiq-inspired aesthetic
- Chalkboard font (or Comic Sans fallback)
- Rotated elements with shadows
- Perfect for brainstorming and early concepts

### Clean Theme
- Modern, polished design
- Inter font family
- Smooth rounded corners
- Professional drop shadows
- Great for client presentations

### Wireframe Theme
- Traditional grayscale
- Helvetica font
- Sharp corners, minimal styling
- Ideal for technical specifications

### Minimal Theme
- Bare-bones semantic HTML
- Basic borders and spacing
- Perfect starting point for custom styling

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` - Import (when textarea is focused)

## Tips & Tricks

### Auto-Layout Best Practices
The plugin uses Figma's auto-layout extensively. Imported designs will:
- Resize automatically when content changes
- Maintain proper spacing between elements
- Support responsive design patterns

### Editing After Import
All elements are fully editable:
- Text: Double-click any text to edit
- Colors: Select element and change fill/stroke
- Spacing: Adjust padding and gaps in auto-layout properties
- Layout: Drag elements to reorder

### Component Creation
Convert repeated elements to components:
1. Select an imported button or card
2. Create Component (Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + K)
3. Reuse across your design

### Working with Grids
Imported grids use horizontal frames with columns:
- Adjust `itemSpacing` to change gaps
- Resize columns independently
- Add/remove columns as needed

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid wiremd JSON" error
- Ensure you're using `--format json` flag with mdmock CLI
- Validate JSON syntax (use jsonlint.com)
- Check that root object has `"type": "document"`

### Missing fonts
The plugin will attempt to load these fonts in order:
1. Theme-specific fonts (Chalkboard, Inter, Helvetica)
2. Roboto (fallback)

If fonts are missing, install them from Google Fonts or use a different theme.

### Large imports are slow
For very large mockups (100+ components):
- Consider breaking into multiple pages
- Import will show progress indicator
- Plugin won't freeze, but may take 10-30 seconds

### Elements look wrong
- Check that your wiremd markdown uses correct syntax
- Try different theme to see if it's theme-specific
- Verify JSON structure matches wiremd spec

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
cd figma-plugin
npm install
npm run build
```

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run watch
```

Then in Figma:
1. Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest
2. Select `manifest.json`
3. Plugin updates automatically on file changes

### Testing

Test with example wiremd files:

```bash
# In wiremd root directory
cd examples
mdmock navigation.md --format json -o nav.json
mdmock form.md --format json -o form.json
mdmock landing-page.md --format json -o landing.json
```

Then import each JSON file through the plugin.
